Hello guys,
this is my own litte game, Tic Tac Toe. Its very simple to play, but it has full online multiplayer ☺. There is a launcher, where you can create an account (even with confirmation emails so no more .kreps emails) or log you in.

In the main lobby you can see all the online players and what they are doing right now (e.g. ingame, online, viewing a game). You can watch players and other Viewers, challenge other players or simply chat with all other people online. On the right side you can see a list off all scores of the online players, so you know, whos the best.

When youre in a game with somebody, you, your opponent player and your viewers have your own chat, so you dont get retracted by the normal lobby chat. On the left you can see a list with all online players and their state (new ones, like is watching this game, or is playing this game). in the middle of the game itself, simply click on an empty field, when promted and you could win ;).

Please dont reproduce/reuse/etc this code, without mention me. Otherwise feel free to do with this code, whatever you want.

With kind regards or like in Germany 'Mit den Besten Grüßen'
